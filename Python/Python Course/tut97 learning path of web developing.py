 # Web development refers to creating and maintaining websites. We usually use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for web development.
# Whether we can learn web development using Flask or using Django.
# Django is a little more accessible to learn than Flask because we can find a lot of built-in functionalities in it,
# that in the case of Flask has to be created manually.But this difference makes Flask faster and more efficient,
# making it take less time to load. It also takes less space on the server.
