# len("Python") # returns 6 as result
# len([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) # returns 9 as result
# Python also implements polymorphism using methods.
# The len() method returns the length of an object.
# In this case, the function len() is polymorphic as it is taking a string as input in the first case which returns total length/characters of the string and in the second case, it is taking list as input.



print(5+6)
print("5" + "6")
