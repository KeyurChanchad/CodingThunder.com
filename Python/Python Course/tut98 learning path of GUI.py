# GUI stands for Graphic User Interface. As can be defined by the name, GUI is an interface with the help of
# which a user can interact with the device. Previously computers didn’t support GUIs, so working with computers
# required a lot of skills as every action can only be performed by using some basic commands that have to be remembered.
# So, you must have figured out that the computer was only a working tool back then. Some of the well-known GUI’s examples include Microsoft Windows, macOS and Ubuntu.


# There are a lot of options available that could help us develop a GUI for our program. Some of the well-known are:
# Tkinter
# wxPython
# JPython

# Tkinter is a very important module in Python. To use Tkinter, we have to import it into our program
# import Tkinter
